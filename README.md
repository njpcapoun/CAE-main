IS&amp;T Classroom Assignment Enhancement - Old Repo

This is all the files and the applicaiton executable in the state before we begin editing and adding our functions. We should not merge this into the master branch, keep it as a backup and if we ever need to show what the old app did versus what our updated version will do. Calling this "Version 1.0", and then maybe when we do a release we need to show off we can start at 2.0 and increment from there.

Also, we should rename what files we can because I don't know what Wpf means.

To get the executable, it's `Wpfapp1/bin/Debug/app.publish/ClassroomAssignmentWpf.rar`

## Basic Repository Instructions:
This is more for when we have an actual codebase, but is a good strategy to using github.

To add changes, first create a branch off of the master branch. This will be your working branch until ready to commit and push the changes. It allows the master branch to act as a good backup in case we ever need to use a previous version. When ready to push changes to the master branch, create a pull-request which will then check the changed files with existing one's on the master branch and look for problems. If all is good, the pull request can be put through and combine the working branch with the master branch.
