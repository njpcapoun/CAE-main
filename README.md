## Project Description:
The App acts as a Course Scheduling helper app. It takes input CSV files from the Course Leaf Scheduling System, and translates the data into a form that is easier to understand and manage. Major Functions of the app include: Course Assignment, Course Editing, Automatic Crosslisting of Sections, Editable Room data, Section reassignment, room recommendations, various weekly schedule views specific to a Room or Teacher, and an export function to display the schedules of assigned courses in an Excel file. 

## Project Setup/Installation
Latest versions of the app can be found in the Releases tab. Download the .msi file and run it to install the app.

If setting up for editing the code, download the files in the repository. The project must be built in Visual Studio. Then, before trying to run it, in the folder WpfApp1/bin/Debug the file RoomData.json must be placed there. The only input that remains is having the right CLSS input files and then the app can run.
